          #### Media Initiatives

          At ESS, our goal is to make sure information is equally accessible to all students. With this goal in mind, we include an accessible description of graphics on all our social media posts and try to avoid posting images on our “stories” with no text. Think we can do better? Send us a message and let us know!

          #### Bilingual Options

          As a Registered Student Government (RSG) at a bilingual university, we strive to make sure you can access information in your preferred language. All social media posts and website content is available in both French and English, and many of our officers are bilingual and are happy to help during our office hours.
