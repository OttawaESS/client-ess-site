                Teams will be given a design challenge based off a general level of engineering knowledge (such as forces, mechanics, etc.) and will be required to build a working prototype using limited time and resources. Teams will then be required to prove their design by actively completing the given challenge, as well as making a complete presentation on their design. Each team will be judged based on their design, application, teamwork, and performance, with regards to both their prototype and presentation.
  
          - header: Who can compete?
            content: >-
                In order to compete, a team must contain between two to four people, all of whom must be uOttawa undergraduate Engineering students in either first or second year of their studies; participants must not be taking any third year engineering classes by March of the following year.

A panel of judges will assess each team’s design based on practicality, originality, feasibility, and marketability.
