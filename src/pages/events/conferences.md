        - title: PEO-SC
          description: The Professional Engineering Ontario Student Conference (PEO-SC) is a student conference hosted annually by ESSCO with support by Professional Engineers Ontario. The goal of the conference is to help upper year students in engineering with the process and opportunities that might arrive through the profession of engineering. Topics include ways to grow your network and opportunities, licensing requirements and non traditional aspects of engineering such as environmental impact and non traditional engineering jobs.

                > A common stream of the conference was none traditional usage of engineering principles. As a Computer Engineering Student who often hears of the struggles of pursuing engineering in technology, this conference showcased the values â€‹â€‹of consulting, politics and business opportunities that engineering fundamentals can be applied to. Furthermore, a lot of topics had valuable lessons of the changing nature of a career and how a starting job can be pivoted to unique and different opportunities.            
        - title: FYIC
          description: The First Year Integration Conference (FYIC) is a conference focused on getting first year students involved in their member schools as the leaders of tomorrow, and also introduces them to the provincial community. The conference features many introductions including introductions to fellow first year students from across the province.

                > Attending FYIC and learning from industry professionals and other well established people sounded like a great idea to me as soon as i heard about it. I was not disappointed. In fact, FYIC Zoomed past my expectations and it was an experience full of ideas, connections, and lessons that I hope will help me throughout my university career and after. Learning about organizations such as OSPE and PEO is something I believe everyone should do! I enjoyed all of the other sessions but mostly the Project Management session, which inspired me to look into a different aspect of engineering as a possible career choice. All in all, the co-chairs and the volunteers at Ontario Tech University made Virtual FYIC an incredible experience and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to attend! ðŸ™‚
        - title: CDE
          description: Conference on Diversity in Engineering (CDE) is a national forum that focuses on diversity in the engineering industry and the role that students will play in creating a more inclusive industry.

                > As an international first-year Computer Engineering student of multi-cultural background, I've truly enjoyed CDE in all of its aspects. I came in there with an open-mind hoping to get educated on complex EDI-related topics and issues and to strengthen my already-existing knowledge on those kinds of subjects, and even though my expectations were somewhat high, I wasn't disappointed.<br>

                My favorite session was the one on systemic racism because it touched on some very insightful points and were adequately established in their contexts. Regardless of the online format of this year's edition, CDE was also the perfect opportunity to get to meet with other fellow Engineering students from across Canada coming from a wide variety of backgrounds. <br>

                It was an incredible experience, and I would recommend it to anyone to consider participating in future editions.

                > Hi! My name is Souleima and I am currently a second-year student in chemical engineering. <br>

                I had the opportunity to attend the Conference of Diversity in Engineering, hosted by the University of Calgary. I was a bit hesitant due to the format of the conference (online), but it was great. It was a way for me to reflect and to see what I, as a future engineer, could do to make it better. It is a bit overwhelming at first when you realize you have a lot to learn but I had a great support! Chloe was always available to answer my questions (and I do ask a lot of them). <br>

                I think that as an engineer you have to care about diversity because this is what makes us stronger as a community, this is how we take better decisions and this is how we can help to make the world a better place for everyone. I 100% recommend! Even if it is online! It was great and breaks were given so you could breathe a little bit! I am happy to have had the opportunity to attend!
