                A common stream of the conference was none traditional usage of engineering principles. As a Computer Engineering Student who often hears of the struggles of pursuing engineering in technology, this conference showcased the values ‚Äã‚Äãof consulting, politics and business opportunities that engineering fundamentals can be applied to. Furthermore, a lot of topics had valuable lessons of the changing nature of a career and how a starting job can be pivoted to unique and different opportunities.            

        - title: FYIC
          description: The First Year Integration Conference (FYIC) is a conference focused on getting first year students involved in their member schools as the leaders of tomorrow, and also introduces them to the provincial community. The conference features many introductions including introductions to fellow first year students from across the province.

                Attending FYIC and learning from industry professionals and other well established people sounded like a great idea to me as soon as i heard about it. I was not disappointed. In fact, FYIC Zoomed past my expectations and it was an experience full of ideas, connections, and lessons that I hope will help me throughout my university career and after. Learning about organizations such as OSPE and PEO is something I believe everyone should do! I enjoyed all of the other sessions but mostly the Project Management session, which inspired me to look into a different aspect of engineering as a possible career choice. All in all, the co-chairs and the volunteers at Ontario Tech University made Virtual FYIC an incredible experience and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to attend! üôÇ

                As an international first-year Computer Engineering student of multi-cultural background, I've truly enjoyed CDE in all of its aspects. I came in there with an open-mind hoping to get educated on complex EDI-related topics and issues and to strengthen my already-existing knowledge on those kinds of subjects, and even though my expectations were somewhat high, I wasn't disappointed.<br>
  
                My favorite session was the one on systemic racism because it touched on some very insightful points and were adequately established in their contexts. Regardless of the online format of this year's edition, CDE was also the perfect opportunity to get to meet with other fellow Engineering students from across Canada coming from a wide variety of backgrounds. <br>
  
                It was an incredible experience, and I would recommend it to anyone to consider participating in future editions.

                Hi! My name is Souleima and I am currently a second-year student in chemical engineering. <br>
  
                I had the opportunity to attend the Conference of Diversity in Engineering, hosted by the University of Calgary. I was a bit hesitant due to the format of the conference (online), but it was great. It was a way for me to reflect and to see what I, as a future engineer, could do to make it better. It is a bit overwhelming at first when you realize you have a lot to learn but I had a great support! Chloe was always available to answer my questions (and I do ask a lot of them). <br>
  
                I think that as an engineer you have to care about diversity because this is what makes us stronger as a community, this is how we take better decisions and this is how we can help to make the world a better place for everyone. I 100% recommend! Even if it is online! It was great and breaks were given so you could breathe a little bit! I am happy to have had the opportunity to attend!

                It took me three years to finally apply for an engineering conference and my only disappointment is not doing it sooner. If there is one thing that CDE2020 / CDI2020 taught me, it is that everyone needs diversity and inclusivity training. The conference, while 100% online, still allowed me to connect with engineering students from all over the country, lead to various networking opportunities and showed me that learning how to be more inclusive is a never ending process. I enjoyed all of the sessions but the one that marked me the most is Intersectionality 101 since it led to great conversations and demonstrated how easy it is to learn how to be more open. This will not be the last conference I apply for and while it might make it harder for me to be chosen, I would highly recommend for everyone to start applying for these amazing events!

                Assister √† FYIC et apprendre des professionnels de l'industrie et d'autres personnes bien √©tablies m'a sembl√© une excellente id√©e d√®s que j'en ai entendu parler. Je n'ai pas √©t√© d√©√ßu. En fait, FYIC a d√©pass√© mes attentes et ce fut une exp√©rience pleine d'id√©es, de connexions et de le√ßons qui, j'esp√®re, m'aideront tout au long de ma carri√®re universitaire et apr√®s aussi. Je pense que tout le monde devrait faire des connaissances sur des organisations telles que OSPE et PEO! J'ai appr√©ci√© toutes les autres sessions, mais surtout la session de gestion de projet, qui m'a inspir√© √† examiner un aspect diff√©rent de l'ing√©nierie comme choix de carri√®re possible. Dans l'ensemble, les copr√©sidents et les b√©n√©voles de l'Universit√© Ontario Tech ont fait de FYIC En Ligne une exp√©rience incroyable et je suis tr√®s reconnaissant d'avoir eu l'occasion d'y assister! üôÇ

                En tant qu'√©tudiant international de premi√®re ann√©e en g√©nie informatique, d'origine multiculturelle, j'ai vraiment appr√©ci√© la CDI sous tous ses aspects. Je suis arriv√© l√†-bas avec un esprit ouvert dans l'espoir de me renseigner sur des sujets et des probl√®mes complexes li√©s √† l'√âDI et de renforcer mes connaissances d√©j√† existantes sur ces types de sujets, et m√™me si mes attentes √©taient un peu √©lev√©es, je n'ai pas √©t√© d√©√ßu.<br>
                
                Ma s√©ance pr√©f√©r√©e a √©t√© celle sur le racisme syst√©mique parce qu'elle touchait √† certains points tr√®s perspicaces et √©tait bien √©tablie dans leurs contextes. Ind√©pendamment du format en ligne de l'√©dition de cette ann√©e, la CDI a √©galement √©t√© l'occasion id√©ale de rencontrer d'autres √©tudiants en g√©nie de partout au Canada venant d'horizons tr√®s divers.<br>
                                
                Ce fut une exp√©rience incroyable et je recommanderais √† tout le monde d'envisager de participer aux prochaines √©ditions.

                Salut ! Je m‚Äôappelle Souleima et je suis une √©tudiante en deuxi√®me ann√©e dans le programme de g√©nie chimique. <br>
                                
                J‚Äôai eu l‚Äôopportunit√© d‚Äôassister √† la Conf√©rence sur la Diversit√© en Ing√©nierie, organis√©e par l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Calgary et qui a eu lieu le weekend du 21 au 22 novembre. Je dois avouer que j‚Äô√©tais un peu sceptique √† cause du format en ligne mais je n‚Äôai pas √©t√© d√©√ßue ! Cette conf√©rence m‚Äôa permis de r√©fl√©chir et de me questionner afin de voir ce que moi, une future ing√©nieure, pourrait faire afin d‚Äôam√©liorer mon domaine. C‚Äô√©tait un peu dur de r√©aliser qu‚Äôil y a beaucoup de choses que nous ne savons pas et qu‚Äôil y a un apprentissage important √† faire mais j‚Äôai b√©n√©fici√© d‚Äôun excellent soutien. Chlo√© √©tait toujours disponible pour r√©pondre √† mes questions (sachant que j‚Äôen pose √©norm√©ment). <br>
                                
                Je pense qu‚Äôen tant qu‚Äôing√©nieur il est n√©cessaire de s‚Äôint√©resser √† la diversit√© puisque c‚Äôest ce qui renforce notre communaut√©, c‚Äôest de cette mani√®re que l‚Äôon prend de meilleures d√©cisions et aussi de cette mani√®re qu‚Äôon progresse ! Je recommande fortement, m√™me si c‚Äôest en ligne ! Le format √©tait bon et il y avait des pauses. Je suis contente d‚Äôavoir eu l‚Äôopportunit√© d‚Äôy assister !

                Il m'a fallu trois ans pour finalement postuler √† une conf√©rence d'ing√©nierie et ma seule d√©ception est de ne pas le faire plus t√¥t. S'il y a une chose que le CDE2020 / CDI2020 m'a appris, c'est que tout le monde a besoin d'une formation sur la diversit√© et l'inclusion. La conf√©rence, bien que 100% en ligne, m'a quand m√™me permis de me connecter avec des √©tudiants en ing√©nierie de tout le pays, de cr√©er diverses opportunit√©s de r√©seautage et m'a montr√© qu'apprendre √† √™tre plus inclusif est un processus sans fin. J'ai appr√©ci√© toutes les sessions, mais celle qui m'a le plus marqu√©e est Intersectionality 101 car elle a conduit √† de belles conversations et a d√©montr√© √† quel point il est facile d'apprendre √† √™tre plus ouvert. Ce ne sera pas la derni√®re conf√©rence √† laquelle je postulerai et m√™me si cela pourrait me compliquer la t√¢che, je recommande vivement √† tout le monde de commencer √† postuler pour ces √©v√©nements incroyables!
