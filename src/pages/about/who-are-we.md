          The Engineering Students’ Society (ESS for short) is an amazing organization run by your fellow students just for you! We plan events, attend conferences and help to make your school experience the best it can be. After paying your awfully expensive tuition, you have contributed an extremely small portion of that money to the Engineering Students’ Society, in exchange for membership.

          All Engineering students are members, and have powers and privileges throughout their academic career at the University of Ottawa. Not only do you get to attend some of the greatest events on campus, but also you get to show all the other faculties that Engineers Rule The World with your super smarts and ability to drink anyone under the table!
