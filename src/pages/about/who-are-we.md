            At uOttawa ESS, we hope to redefine engineering culture, and ensure everyone feels as though they belong. We strive to create an inviting and positive learning environment for all our members. The ESS believes the tradition should never stand in the way of progress, and try to consider the following core values in all we do…
  
  
            **Respect and Empathy:** We aim to understand and respect the perspectives of all our members and consider them in all the organization’s operations
  
  
            **Ethics, Transparency, and Accessibility:** We aim to have complete transparency in our organization and work to ensure all decisions are made ethically. We strive to make our operations accessible to all members, regardless of their ability.
  
  
            **Accountability:** We aim to continuously clearly identify any difficulties within the organization, remedy them, and grow from our experiences.
