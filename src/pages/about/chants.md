            ### Godiva’s Hymn

            *Order of verses does not matter except for first*<br>

            [Chorus]<br>
            We are We are We are We are We are the engineers<br>
            We can We can We can We can Demolish forty beers<br>
            Drink rum Drink rum Drink rum Drink rum And come along with us<br>
            For we don't give a damn for any damn man who don't give a damn for us<br><br>

            [First Verse]<br>
            Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride<br>
            To show to all the villagers her lovely, bare white hide<br>
            The most observant villager, an engineer of course<br>
            Was the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse<br><br>

            Said she, "I’ve come a long, long way, and I will go as far,<br>
            With the man who takes me from this horse, and leads me to a bar."<br>
            The men who took her from her steed, and led her to a beer,<br>
            Were a bleary-eyed Surveyor and a drunken Engineer.<br><br>

            Godiva woke next morning and she had an awful head,<br>
            Decided to be sensible and spend the day in bed.<br>
            The only ones to visit her and bring her lots of cheer,<br>
            Were a broken-down Surveyor and a bloodshot Engineer.<br><br>

            Godiva died and where she fell a bench marks the spot,<br>
            In any Engineering text, its level can be got.<br>
            And up in Heaven, every day Godiva craves for beer,<br>
            But she'll have to wait until the gates let in the Engineers.<br><br>

            Godiva was a lady well-endowed, there was no doubt.<br>
            She never wore a stitch of clothes, just wound her hair about.<br>
            The first man who ever made her was an Engineer of course,<br>
            But on just one drink, an Artsie fink once made Godiva's horse.<br>

            ### Godiva’s Hymn Substitutes

            I came across a girl whose skin was glazed in purple hue,<br>
            Her aura proud, her spirit loud, her words were strong and true;<br>
            She led a group of hundreds who were chanting far and near,<br>
            And in my mind, I had no doubt - she led the engineers!<br><br>

            We are We are We are We are the female engineers<br>
            We can We can We can We can Drink twice as many beers<br>
            So come So come So come So come So come along with us<br>
            For we don't give a damn for any old man Who can’t get it up for us<br><br>

            We are we are we are we are the engiqueers<br>
            we love to sip and spill the tea while slamming 40 beers<br>
            So come so come so come so come so come from far and near<br>
            And give three cheers for we the queers who study tech and gears<br><br>

            A firehose by day and forty beers by night,<br>
            An engineer may never sleep but still stay just as bright.<br>
            And if you ever ask her how she keeps up her routine,<br>
            She'll raise her trusty can of Redbull, smile and say 'Caffeine!'<br><br>

            A man sat in a tavern with a lovely looking lass<br>
            And stared when for the nineteenth time she raised and drank her glass<br>
            "You've out-drunk four strong men, and half the bar my dear"<br>
            The maiden smiled sweetly, and said "I'm an Engineer!"<br><br>

            Nous sommes, nous sommes, nous sommes, nous sommes les ingénieurs français<br>
            Quand on a fini de boire la bière, on sort le Bourgelais<br>
            On boit sans fin, on fait la fête et tout le monde nous adorent<br>
            Rien de mieux que la langue française pour stimuler un corps.<br><br>

            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br>
            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br>
            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br>
            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br><br>

            A wide-eyed Artsie Chemist and a Chemical Engineer,<br>
            Were formulating molecule equations over beer.<br>
            Each drank a glass of water, but the Artsie hit the floor,<br>
            For what he thought was H2O was H2SO4.<br><br>

            When the mechs are tired and the civils are worn out,<br>
            There’s just one place to go and that’s a bar without a doubt<br>
            So the next time that you drink a golden, frothy beer<br>
            Get on your worthless knees and thank a chemical Engineer<br><br>

            Said the beauty to the Engineer, "My beer is getting warm.<br>
            Unless some more is brought to me, I'll retire to the dorm."<br>
            The Engineer said, "Go to hell, I'm not a money tree,<br>
            If you're so goddamn thirsty, you can buy a beer for me"<br><br>

            A Comp and an Elec did battle outside Bahen hall,<br>
            Students gathered round to watch the two great students brawl.<br>
            The Elec spoke of flux and fields for a minute, two, or three,<br>
            But the Comp kept rambling on and on and on recursively!<br><br>

            All EngSci types in second year are really in a plight,<br>
            They're the masochistic ones, who haven't seen the light,<br>
            After two more years they will all be just as brain dead,<br><br>
            As any first-year Civil Engineering cement head.

            We're lost, we're lost, we're lost, we're lost, we don't know where we are,<br>
            We want, we want, we want, we want, we want to find a bar.<br>
            Don't come, don't come, don't come, don't come, don't come along with us,<br>
            For we don't know where the hell we are but fuck we're on a bus!<br><br>

            The Army and the Navy boys went out to have some fun,<br>
            Down at the local tavern where the fiery liquors run.<br>
            But all they found were empties for the Engineers had come,<br>
            And traded all their instruments for gallon jugs of rum.<br><br>

            Professors put demands on us, they say we have to tool,<br>
            But all we want to do is sleep, we hate this fucking school.<br>
            You can bitch or tell us off, even abuse us if you please,<br>
            But we're all set to graduate, and all we need are C's!<br><br>

            An Engineer from U of T once found the gates of Hell,<br>
            They looked the devil in the eye and said, "You're looking well."<br>
            Satan just returned the glare and said, "Why visit me?<br>
            You've been through Hell already, you went to U of T!"<br>

            Venus is a statue made entirely of stone,<br>
            There's not a fig leaf on her, she's as naked as a bone.<br>
            On noticing her arms were gone, an Engineer discoursed,<br>
            "The damn thing's busted concrete and it should be reinforced."<br><br>

            An Engineer once came to class so drunk and very late,<br>
            He stumbled through the lecture hall at an ever-diminishing rate.<br>
            The only things that held him up and kept him on his course,<br>
            Were the boundary condition and the electromotive force.<br><br>

            A modern Engineer must be politically correct,<br>
            No more motors lubricating, no more buildings stand erect,<br>
            No more electrical capacitors whose plates are high and fair,<br>
            Instead of problem solving let’s just sit around and care<br><br>

            Sir Francis Drake and all his men set out for Calais Bay,<br>
            They'd heard the Spanish Rum fleet was headed up that way.<br>
            But the Engineers had beat them by a night and half a day,<br>
            And though as drunk as they could be, you still could hear them say…<br><br>

            Rapunzel let her hair down for two suitors down below,<br>
            So one of them could grab a hold and give the old heave-ho.<br>
            The prince began to climb at once, but soon came out the worst,<br>
            For the Engineer rode up a lift and reached Rapunzel first.<br><br>

            Elvis was a legend, he's the King of Rock & Roll,<br>
            But the life he was leading, well it finally took its toll,<br>
            He realized too late that he chose the wrong career,<br>
            So he faked his death, and came to school to become an Engineer.<br><br>

            An Artsie and an Engineer once found a gallon can,<br>
            Said the Artsie, “Match me drink for drink as long as you can stand.”<br>
            They took three drinks, the Artsie fell, his face was turning green,<br>
            But the Engineer drank on and said, "It's only gasoline"!<br><br>

            An commie and an Engineer were sitting in a boat,<br>
            One person too heavy, the damn thing wouldn’t float.<br>
            The Engineer would flip a coin to settle the dispute,<br>
            So he flipped it in the water and the commie gave pursuit.<br><br>

            So now you’ve heard our story and you know we are the Engineers,<br>
            And when we all shall graduate, we’ll all have great careers.<br>
            An Engineer’s starting wage can pull in 60 G’s,<br>
            While an Artsie with a Ph.D. can work at Mickey D’s.<br><br>

            The men from arts, they think their great but I won’t give them cheers<br>
            They can’t do basic calculus and can’t drink forty beers<br>
            So listen to me ladies and don’t give them half a glance,<br>
            Because before they even touch you they will jizz right in their pants. <br><br>

            On reading Karma Sutra, a guy learned position nine<br>
            For proving masculinity, it truly was divine.<br>
            But then one day the girl rebelled and threw him on his rear,<br>
            For he was a feeble artsie and she was an Engineer.<br><br>

            A maiden and an Engineer were sitting in the park,<br>
            The Engineer was busy doing research after dark.<br>
            His scientific method was a marvel to observe,<br>
            While his right hand wrote the figures down, his left hand traced the curves.<br><br>

            All the other faculties seem to stress the fact,<br>
            That engineers are never laid because the way they act<br>
            But I can assure you that the girls they get their kicks<br>
            From the men who study lubrication dynamics!<br><br>

            My father peddles opium, my mother's on the dole,<br>
            My sister used to walk the streets but now she's on parole,<br>
            My brother runs a restaurant with bedrooms in the rear,<br>
            But they don't even speak to me 'cause I'm an Engineer.<br><br>

            At the Arts Quad at our school there are many untruths told<br>
            'bout how female engineers are frigid, strange, and cold,<br>
            But truth be told men look for lady engineers of course,<br>
            And sleep with girls who study friction, motion, stress and force.<br><br>

            I happened once upon a maid whose eyes were full of fire,<br>
            Her physical endowments would make your hands perspire,<br>
            She shocked us when she told us that she never had been kissed,<br>
            For her boyfriend was a worn-out Engineering Scientist.<br><br>

            If I should find a carleton man within our sacred walls, <br>
            I’ll take him to the physics lab and amputate his balls, <br>
            and if he hollers uncle well I'll tell you what we'll do, <br>
            we'll shove his ass with broken glass and seal it up with glue.<br><br>

            La la la la…<br><br>

            [Final Verse]<br>
            Now you've heard our story and you know we're Engineers,<br>
            We love to hate our problem sets, we love to drink our beers.<br>
            We drink to every person who comes here from far and near,<br>
            'Cause we're a HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-AN-ENGINEER!!!

          Call and Repeat<br><br>

          I don't know what I've been told,<br>
          Give me something nice and cold,<br>
          How 'bout 40 cold free beers,<br>
          Because we are the engineers!<br><br>

          I don't know what I've been told,<br>
          Half my prof's are way too old,<br>
          So I've been drinking beer all day,<br>
          Say goodbye to my GPA!<br><br>

          I don't know what I've been told,<br>
          This much knowledge I can't hold,<br>
          My GPA was killing me,<br>
          C's and D's got my degree!<br><br>

          I don't know what I've been told,<br>
          Colonel By is full of mold,<br>
          I may be a Gee-Gee,<br>
          But SITE's the only place for me!<br><br>

          I met an artsie weeks ago,<br>
          He asked if my food was to go,<br>
          His four years went down the drain,<br>
          The engineers will make it rain!<br><br>

          I don't know what I've been told,<br>
          Engineers rule the world,<br>
          Demolishing 40 beers,<br>
          No fucking problem for engineers!<br><br>

          We've been traveling oh so far,<br>
          Still haven't found a single bar,<br>
          We are lost but that's okay,<br>
          The bus driver knows we're here to stay!<br><br>

          Late at night I'm still not done,<br>
          I'm thinking I'm starting to see the Sun,<br>
          The last all-nighter of the year,<br>
          But that's ok cause we're engineers!<br><br>

          I don't know what I've been told,<br>
          Scientists are way too bold,<br>
          They say they're rich, they're hypocrites,<br>
          Cause their degrees aren't worth 2 shits!
