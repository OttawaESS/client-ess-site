            ### Godiva’s Hymn

            *Order of verses does not matter except for first*<br>

            [Chorus]<br>
            We are We are We are We are We are the engineers<br>
            We can We can We can We can Demolish forty beers<br>
            Drink rum Drink rum Drink rum Drink rum And come along with us<br>
            For we don't give a damn for any damn man who don't give a damn for us<br><br>

            [First Verse]<br>
            Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride<br>
            To show to all the villagers her lovely, bare white hide<br>
            The most observant villager, an engineer of course<br>
            Was the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse<br><br>

            Said she, "I’ve come a long, long way, and I will go as far,<br>
            With the man who takes me from this horse, and leads me to a bar."<br>
            The men who took her from her steed, and led her to a beer,<br>
            Were a bleary-eyed Surveyor and a drunken Engineer.<br><br>

            Godiva woke next morning and she had an awful head,<br>
            Decided to be sensible and spend the day in bed.<br>
            The only ones to visit her and bring her lots of cheer,<br>
            Were a broken-down Surveyor and a bloodshot Engineer.<br><br>

            Godiva died and where she fell a bench marks the spot,<br>
            In any Engineering text, its level can be got.<br>
            And up in Heaven, every day Godiva craves for beer,<br>
            But she'll have to wait until the gates let in the Engineers.<br><br>

            Godiva was a lady well-endowed, there was no doubt.<br>
            She never wore a stitch of clothes, just wound her hair about.<br>
            The first man who ever made her was an Engineer of course,<br>
            But on just one drink, an Artsie fink once made Godiva's horse.<br>

            ### Godiva’s Hymn Substitutes

            I came across a girl whose skin was glazed in purple hue,<br>
            Her aura proud, her spirit loud, her words were strong and true;<br>
            She led a group of hundreds who were chanting far and near,<br>
            And in my mind, I had no doubt - she led the engineers!<br><br>

            We are We are We are We are the female engineers<br>
            We can We can We can We can Drink twice as many beers<br>
            So come So come So come So come So come along with us<br>
            For we don't give a damn for any old man Who can’t get it up for us<br><br>

            We are we are we are we are the engiqueers<br>
            we love to sip and spill the tea while slamming 40 beers<br>
            So come so come so come so come so come from far and near<br>
            And give three cheers for we the queers who study tech and gears<br><br>

            A firehose by day and forty beers by night,<br>
            An engineer may never sleep but still stay just as bright.<br>
            And if you ever ask her how she keeps up her routine,<br>
            She'll raise her trusty can of Redbull, smile and say 'Caffeine!'<br><br>

            A man sat in a tavern with a lovely looking lass<br>
            And stared when for the nineteenth time she raised and drank her glass<br>
            "You've out-drunk four strong men, and half the bar my dear"<br>
            The maiden smiled sweetly, and said "I'm an Engineer!"<br><br>

            Nous sommes, nous sommes, nous sommes, nous sommes les ingénieurs français<br>
            Quand on a fini de boire la bière, on sort le Bourgelais<br>
            On boit sans fin, on fait la fête et tout le monde nous adorent<br>
            Rien de mieux que la langue française pour stimuler un corps.<br><br>

            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br>
            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br>
            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br>
            Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis Je suis un ananas<br><br>

            A wide-eyed Artsie Chemist and a Chemical Engineer,<br>
            Were formulating molecule equations over beer.<br>
            Each drank a glass of water, but the Artsie hit the floor,<br>
            For what he thought was H2O was H2SO4.<br><br>

            When the mechs are tired and the civils are worn out,<br>
            There’s just one place to go and that’s a bar without a doubt<br>
            So the next time that you drink a golden, frothy beer<br>
            Get on your worthless knees and thank a chemical Engineer<br><br>

            Said the beauty to the Engineer, "My beer is getting warm.<br>
            Unless some more is brought to me, I'll retire to the dorm."<br>
            The Engineer said, "Go to hell, I'm not a money tree,<br>
            If you're so goddamn thirsty, you can buy a beer for me"<br><br>

            A Comp and an Elec did battle outside Bahen hall,<br>
            Students gathered round to watch the two great students brawl.<br>
            The Elec spoke of flux and fields for a minute, two, or three,<br>
            But the Comp kept rambling on and on and on recursively!<br><br>

            All EngSci types in second year are really in a plight,<br>
            They're the masochistic ones, who haven't seen the light,<br>
            After two more years they will all be just as brain dead,<br><br>
            As any first-year Civil Engineering cement head.

            We're lost, we're lost, we're lost, we're lost, we don't know where we are,<br>
            We want, we want, we want, we want, we want to find a bar.<br>
            Don't come, don't come, don't come, don't come, don't come along with us,<br>
            For we don't know where the hell we are but fuck we're on a bus!<br><br>

            The Army and the Navy boys went out to have some fun,<br>
            Down at the local tavern where the fiery liquors run.<br>
            But all they found were empties for the Engineers had come,<br>
            And traded all their instruments for gallon jugs of rum.<br><br>

            Professors put demands on us, they say we have to tool,<br>
            But all we want to do is sleep, we hate this fucking school.<br>
            You can bitch or tell us off, even abuse us if you please,<br>
            But we're all set to graduate, and all we need are C's!<br><br>

            An Engineer from U of T once found the gates of Hell,<br>
            They looked the devil in the eye and said, "You're looking well."<br>
            Satan just returned the glare and said, "Why visit me?<br>
            You've been through Hell already, you went to U of T!"<br>

            Venus is a statue made entirely of stone,<br>
            There's not a fig leaf on her, she's as naked as a bone.<br>
            On noticing her arms were gone, an Engineer discoursed,<br>
            "The damn thing's busted concrete and it should be reinforced."<br><br>

            An Engineer once came to class so drunk and very late,<br>
            He stumbled through the lecture hall at an ever-diminishing rate.<br>
            The only things that held him up and kept him on his course,<br>
            Were the boundary condition and the electromotive force.<br><br>

            A modern Engineer must be politically correct,<br>
            No more motors lubricating, no more buildings stand erect,<br>
            No more electrical capacitors whose plates are high and fair,<br>
            Instead of problem solving let’s just sit around and care<br><br>

            Sir Francis Drake and all his men set out for Calais Bay,<br>
            They'd heard the Spanish Rum fleet was headed up that way.<br>
            But the Engineers had beat them by a night and half a day,<br>
            And though as drunk as they could be, you still could hear them say…<br><br>

            Rapunzel let her hair down for two suitors down below,<br>
            So one of them could grab a hold and give the old heave-ho.<br>
            The prince began to climb at once, but soon came out the worst,<br>
            For the Engineer rode up a lift and reached Rapunzel first.<br><br>

            Elvis was a legend, he's the King of Rock & Roll,<br>
            But the life he was leading, well it finally took its toll,<br>
            He realized too late that he chose the wrong career,<br>
            So he faked his death, and came to school to become an Engineer.<br><br>

            An Artsie and an Engineer once found a gallon can,<br>
            Said the Artsie, “Match me drink for drink as long as you can stand.”<br>
            They took three drinks, the Artsie fell, his face was turning green,<br>
            But the Engineer drank on and said, "It's only gasoline"!<br><br>

            An commie and an Engineer were sitting in a boat,<br>
            One person too heavy, the damn thing wouldn’t float.<br>
            The Engineer would flip a coin to settle the dispute,<br>
            So he flipped it in the water and the commie gave pursuit.<br><br>

            So now you’ve heard our story and you know we are the Engineers,<br>
            And when we all shall graduate, we’ll all have great careers.<br>
            An Engineer’s starting wage can pull in 60 G’s,<br>
            While an Artsie with a Ph.D. can work at Mickey D’s.<br><br>

            The men from arts, they think their great but I won’t give them cheers<br>
            They can’t do basic calculus and can’t drink forty beers<br>
            So listen to me ladies and don’t give them half a glance,<br>
            Because before they even touch you they will jizz right in their pants. <br><br>

            On reading Karma Sutra, a guy learned position nine<br>
            For proving masculinity, it truly was divine.<br>
            But then one day the girl rebelled and threw him on his rear,<br>
            For he was a feeble artsie and she was an Engineer.<br><br>

            A maiden and an Engineer were sitting in the park,<br>
            The Engineer was busy doing research after dark.<br>
            His scientific method was a marvel to observe,<br>
            While his right hand wrote the figures down, his left hand traced the curves.<br><br>

            All the other faculties seem to stress the fact,<br>
            That engineers are never laid because the way they act<br>
            But I can assure you that the girls they get their kicks<br>
            From the men who study lubrication dynamics!<br><br>

            My father peddles opium, my mother's on the dole,<br>
            My sister used to walk the streets but now she's on parole,<br>
            My brother runs a restaurant with bedrooms in the rear,<br>
            But they don't even speak to me 'cause I'm an Engineer.<br><br>

            At the Arts Quad at our school there are many untruths told<br>
            'bout how female engineers are frigid, strange, and cold,<br>
            But truth be told men look for lady engineers of course,<br>
            And sleep with girls who study friction, motion, stress and force.<br><br>

            I happened once upon a maid whose eyes were full of fire,<br>
            Her physical endowments would make your hands perspire,<br>
            She shocked us when she told us that she never had been kissed,<br>
            For her boyfriend was a worn-out Engineering Scientist.<br><br>

            If I should find a carleton man within our sacred walls, <br>
            I’ll take him to the physics lab and amputate his balls, <br>
            and if he hollers uncle well I'll tell you what we'll do, <br>
            we'll shove his ass with broken glass and seal it up with glue.<br><br>

            La la la la…<br><br>

            [Final Verse]<br>
            Now you've heard our story and you know we're Engineers,<br>
            We love to hate our problem sets, we love to drink our beers.<br>
            We drink to every person who comes here from far and near,<br>
            'Cause we're a HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-A, HELL-OF-AN-ENGINEER!!!<br>

            And that’s the way we get down<br>

            #### Drunken Engineering Response

            We drink cold beer<br>
            We also drink warm beer<br>
            We bring a flask to class and chug from a mug<br>
            And that’s the way we get down<br>

               Ceux-ci sont les Directeurs de la Société des Étudiants en ingénierie. Ils sont des individus spécialisés dans une zone qui soutient et aide les membres exécutifs dans l'achèvement de leurs rôles. Ils travaillent fort pour assurer chaque détail, peu importe son importance. Les Directeurs obtiennent le fantassin du travail, mais sont excellents à ce qu'ils font et ne devraient pas être négligés.

               Il n'y a qu'un seul casque bleu. Cette personne est le coordonnateur de la semaine 101 et a reçu une distinction spéciale pour ses services rendus à l'évènement le plus amusant 'année. Il mérite le même niveau de révérence que les casques blancs.

               Il s'agit des membres du comité de la semaine 101. Ils sont les maîtres d'œuvre de tous les événements et activités de la semaine. Ces chapeaux bleu foncé sont essentiels pour assurer le bon déroulement des activités. Ils sont comme vos guides habituels, sauf qu'ils ont des connaissances spécialisées dans tout ce qui concerne la Semaine 101 et qu'ils relèvent du coordonnateur de la Semaine 101.

Demandez-leurs n'importe quoi et ils seront contents de vous aider. Tout ce qu'ils disent est la loi pour toute la semaine.

               Ils sont vos guides. Ces pauvres esprits, ainsi que vos exécutifs et vos guides-chefs, s'abstiennent de l'alcool pour la semaine pour que vous ayez une semaine fantastique. Respectez ceux en violet; quand ils parlent, vous écoutez.

               Les innocents sont faciles à voir en jaune. Mais soyez fiers de vos casques... Le jaune veut dire que vous n'êtes pas encore un étudiant expérimenté en génie! Étudiez fort et allez à beaucoup d'évènements et vous avancerez bientôt!

              Il y a longtemps, les Gardiens ont été assignés la tâche de trouver une mascotte qui représentera les étudiants de génie de l’université d’Ottawa de chaque génération. Après des disputes innombrables, ils se-sont finalement mis d'accord sur le lapin. Les lapins sont des symboles du succès, de la durabilité et de la survie uniquement grâce à leur masse besoin / capacité de procréer (en d’autres mots: ils ont beaucoup de sexe). À la surprise des Gardiens, après la capture de leur nouvelle mascotte ils ont réalisé qu'il n'était pas un lapin ordinaire. Il allait bientôt arriver à obtenir tous les quatre diplômes de génie en même temps, en fêtant plus fort que n'importe quel autre étudiant de l'université d'Ottawa. Son nom est Otis.
              <br><br>
              Qu’est-ce qu’il faut se souvenir d’Otis : <br>
              Ils lui ont donné le nom de l’entreprise qui a construit les ascenseurs de CBY et la majorité des autres bâtiments à l’université. <br>
              Il demeure dans CBY (c’est le Bunny Cave … shh) <br>
              Habituellement, il est ivre quand il ne travaille pas; résultant dans son sobriquet le lapin intoxiqué.
